\section{Sample Forces}
\subsection{Gravitational Force}

\begin{definition}[Gravitational Force]
	The gravitational force between 2 particles of {\em mass} $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, situated at $\underline{r_{1}}$ and $\underline{r_{2}}$ (i.e. the force felt by particle 1 because of the prescence of particle 2) is given by
	$$\underline{F_{12}} = \frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{\mid r_{1} - r_{2} \mid^{2}} \ \frac{\underline{r_{1}} - \underline{r_{2}}}{\mid \underline{r_{1}} - \underline{r_{2}} \mid}$$
	$$\underline{F_{21}} = \frac{Gm_{2}m_{1}}{\mid r_{2} - r_{1} \mid^{2}} \ \frac{\underline{r_{1}} - \underline{r_{2}}}{\mid \underline{r_{1}} - \underline{r_{2}} \mid}$$
	where the two forces are {\bf equal} and {\bf opposite in direction}:  $$\underline{F_{12}} = -\underline{F_{21}}$$
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
	The vectors:
	$$\ \frac{\underline{r_{1}} - \underline{r_{2}}}{\mid \underline{r_{1}} - \underline{r_{2}} \mid} \ \ \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \ \  \frac{\underline{r_{2}} - \underline{r_{1}}}{\mid \underline{r_{2}} - \underline{r_{1}} \mid}$$
	are {\bf unit vectors}. That is they give the {\em direction} of the gravitational force, and it is in the {\bf direction directed towards each other}.

\end{note}

\subsubsection{Gravitational Constant}

\begin{definition}[Gravitational Constant]
	The {\bf gravitational constant} $G$ is a {\bf constant} that is used to {\bf quantify} the {\bf attractive force} between two objects with {\bf mass}. It is {\bf approximately} equal to
	$$G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \ \text{m}^{3} \ \text{kg}^{-1} \ \text{s}^{-2}$$
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Gravitational Force Near the Earth's Surface}

\begin{definition}[Gravitational Force Near the Earth's Surface]
	The {\bf gravitational force} near the Earth's surface is given by
	$$\underline{F} = m\underline{g} = -mg\underline{k}$$
	where $m$ is the {\bf mass} of the object and $\underline{g}$ is the {\bf gravitational acceleration} near the Earth's surface. The {\bf gravitational acceleration} near the Earth's surface is given by
	$$g = \frac{Gm_{earth}}{R^{2}_{earth}} \approx 9.8m/s^2 $$
\end{definition}
\begin{note}
	Hence {\em near} the Earth, {\bf Newton's Equation of Motion} (\ref{eq: equation-of-motion}) becomes:
	$$\begin{aligned} m\underline{\ddot{r}} = -mg\underline{k} &\Rightarrow \underline{\ddot{r}} = -mg\underline{k} \end{aligned}$$
	i.e gravitational acceleration is {\bf independent of the mass}.

\end{note}
