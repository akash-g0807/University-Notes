\section{Standard Basis}
Standard basis vectors are also known as standard unit vectors. These are used to represent vectors in $\mathbb{E}^3$

\begin{definition}
  The standard basis vectors are defined as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    \hat{i} &= (1, 0, 0 ) \\
    \hat{j} &=  (0, 1, 0) \\
    \hat{k} &=  (0, 0, 1)
  \end{align*}
such that $\mid \hat{i} \mid = \mid \hat{j} \mid = \mid \hat{k} \mid.$ 
\end{definition}

Any vecor can be represented
